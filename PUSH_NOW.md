## Important Files Created

I've created these helpful files for you:

1. **`.gitignore`** - Prevents sensitive files from being pushed
   - Excludes: node_modules, .env, build files
   
2. **`.env.example`** - Template for environment variables
   - Safe to share, doesn't contain actual secrets
   
3. **`README.md`** - Professional project documentation
   - Updated with your project details
   
4. **`GITHUB_SETUP.md`** - Detailed GitHub guide
   - For more advanced operations
   
5. **`QUICK_START.md`** - Quick reference for common commands

## Protected Files (Won't be pushed) 🔒

These files are in `.gitignore` and won't be uploaded to GitHub:
- ❌ `.env` (your secrets are safe!)
- ❌ `node_modules/` (too large, can be reinstalled)
- ❌ Build files and logs
